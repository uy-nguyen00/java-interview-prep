## Passage 1: China's One Child Policy

> Instituted in 1979 as a temporary measure to limit population growth, China's one child policy remains in force today and is likely to continue for another decade. China's population control policy has attracted criticism because of the manner in which it is enforced, and also because of its social repercussions.
> Supporters of the Chinese government's policy consider it a necessary measure to curb extreme overpopulation, which has resulted in a reduction of an estimated 300 million people in its first twenty years. Not only is a reduced population environmentally beneficial, it also increases China's per capita gross domestic product.
> The one-child policy has led to a disparate ratio of males to females - with abortion, abandonment and infanticide of female infants resulting from a cultural preference for sons. Furthermore, Draconian measures such as forced sterilization are strongly opposed by critics as a violation of human reproduction rights.
> The one-child policy is enforced strictly in urban areas, whereas in provincial regions fines are imposed on families with more than one child. There are also exceptions to the rules - for example, ethnic minorities. A rule also allows couples without siblings to have two children a provision which applies to millions of sibling-free adults now of child-bearing age.

### Q1: China's one-child policy increases the country's wealth

* **Answer:** Cannot Say

* **Explanation:** The fourth sentence states that the policy increases China's **per capita** gross domestic product; however, this is just one economic indicator and is based on output per person. The passage does not tell us if overall, the country **as a whole** has increased wealth due to the one-child policy. Since the passage does not tell us either way, we must respond Cannot Say.

### Q2: The passage suggests that two-child families will dramatically increase, as sibling-free adults reach child-bearing age.

* **Answer:** False
* **Explanation:** The last sentence merely presents the fact that millions of sibling-free couples are able to have two children, and **does not speculate** as to the implications.

### Q3: The general preference among Chinese parents is for male babies.

* **Answer:** True

* **Explanation:** The fifth sentence tells us that "a disparate ratio of males to females" is the result of "a cultural preference for sons". Whilst it might be impossible to make assumptions about what each parent's preference is, the key word in the statement is "general" which means we can look at the overall trend, in this case towards sons.

## Passage 2: American Indian Tribes

> There are 574 federally recognized American Indian tribes, with a total of 1.7 million members. Additionally, there are hundreds of groups seeking federal recognition - or sovereignty - though less than ten percent will successfully achieve this status.
> Federally recognised tribes have the right to self-government, and are also eligible for federal assistance programmes. Exempt from state and local jurisdiction, tribes may enforce their own laws, request tax breaks and control regulatory activities. There are however limitations to their sovereignty including, amongst others, the ability to make war and create currency.
> Historically, tribes were granted federal recognition through treaties or by executive order. Since 1978 however, this has been replaced by a lengthy and stringent regulatory process which requires tribes applying for federal recognition to fulfil seven criteria, such as anthropological and historical evidence.
> One of the complications regarding federal recognition is the legal definition of "Indian". Previously, racial criteria, tribal records and personal affidavits were used to classify American Indians. Since the 1970s, however, there has been a shift to the use of a political definition - requiring membership in a federally recognized tribe in order to qualify for benefits, such as loans and educational grants. This definition, however, excludes many individuals of Native American heritage who are not tribal members.

### Q4: There are only two exemptions to a federally recognized tribe's powers of self-government

* **Answer:** False

* **Explanation:** The fifth sentence states that there are "limitations" and cites two "amongst others". So we are told there are more than two limitations.

### Q5: Demand for federal recognition is high because it is a prerequisite for benefit programmes

* **Answer:** Cannot Say

* **Explanation:** The passage does not specify why hundreds of groups are seeking federal recognition. Even though one might postulate demand is due to receiving benefits, the passage does not tell us this is or is not the case, so we cannot say.

### Q6: A large number of people who identify themselves as American Indians do not fulfill the legal definition

* **Answer:** True

* **Explanation:** The second sentence states that there are hundreds of groups attempting to attain federal recognition. The final two sentences states that the legal definition of Indian is membership in a federally recognised tribe. Thus, it follows that many American Indians do not fulfil the legal definition.

## Passage 3: Sodium Chloride (Salt)

> Sodium chloride, or salt, is essential for human life. Typically derived from the evaporation of sea water or the mining of rock salt deposits, salt has been used by humans for thousands of years as a food seasoning and preservative.
> The mineral sodium is an electrolyte - an electrically-charged ion - that enables cells to carry electrical impulses to other cells, for example muscle contractions. Electrolytes also regulate the body's fluid levels. A diet deficient in salt can cause muscle cramps, neurological problems and even death. Conversely, a diet high in salt leads to an increased risk of conditions such as hypertension, heart disease and stroke.
> In spite of high-profile campaigns to raise awareness, salt consumption has increased by 50% in the past four decades, with the average adult ingesting more than double the amount of salt their body requires. Much of this increase can be attributed to the advent of frozen and processed foods in the mid-twentieth century.
> In the United States it is estimated that excessive salt consumption claims 150,000 lives and results in $24 billion of health care costs annually. For individuals wishing to reduce their sodium intake, the answer is not simply rejecting the salt shaker; 75% of the average person's salt consumption comes from food, such as bread, cereals, and cheese.

### Q7: Frozen and processed foods contain no more salt than contained in a typical die

* **Answer:** Cannot Say

* **Explanation:** The 7th sentence states that salt consumption has increased 50%, and the 8th sentence states "much of this increase can be attributed to the advent of frozen and processed foods". However, this increase could be from an increase in the **volume** of consumption rather than the frozen and processed foods containing higher salt content. We do not have enough information to be sure.

### Q8: Over three quarters of the average person's salt consumption comes from frozen foods

* **Answer:** False

* **Explanation:** The last sentence of the passage states that 75% of the average person's salt intake comes from "food, such as bread, cereals and cheese". Even if all of this food were classed as frozen (highly implausible) this would still only get us to 75% of the average person's salt intake; it would not get us to 'over three quarters' as the statement says.

### Q9: The human body needs salt to maintain constant levels of body fluids.

* **Answer:** Cannot Say

* **Explanation:** The third and fourth sentences tell us that salt contains electrolytes, and that electrolytes "regulate the body's fluid levels". However, we are not told if these electrolytes can be found in **other** foods or drinks, thus we cannot say. Also, don't be misled by the first sentence "salt, is essential for human life"; since this sentence alone does not tell us that salt is essential to maintain levels of body fluids.
